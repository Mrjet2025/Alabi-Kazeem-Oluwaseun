### [Shiny App for  sales analysis and Epidemiological model](https://mrjet2025.shinyapps.io/PowerBI/)
üìä Real-time Simulation of epidemic models (SIR)

üõ†Ô∏è Parameter Control sliders for infection rate, recovery rate, population, etc.

üìà Interactive Visualizations including:

- Line charts of susceptible/infected/recovered populations

- Drill-down bar charts for subgroup analysis

- Data tables with model outputs


### [Analysis of no-show appointment with R](http://rpubs.com/Mrjet2020/1260641)
#### The project addressed the following question.
- Does the intervals between scheduledDays and appointmentDays have impact on  noshow rate.
- Are there days that when patient rarely visit hospital to meet up with.

- Does the age group have impact on the no-show  rate.
- Do patient with more than one diseases increase no-show rate.
- Is the follow up scheme used appropriately.
 
### [Analysis of chips sales with R ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tg9Mu_1fYltgEG1EQC00vc3EQj3X8Qwd/view?usp=sharing)

### [Analysis Buzz's with Excel ]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tg9Mu_1fYltgEG1EQC00vc3EQj3X8Qwd/view?usp=sharing])
#### Insight
- Analyzed over 24,000 content posts to identify top-performing content categories for Social Buzz, a fast-growing tech company preparing for IPO.
- Performed data cleaning, modeling, and sentiment analysis to extract meaningful insights from high-volume unstructured data.
- Created visualizations (pie charts, bar plots) to highlight content distribution, sentiment trends, and seasonal posting behavior.
- Identified Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Food, and Technology as the top 5 most popular content categories.
- Found that 56% of content had positive sentiment, and May was the month with the highest content creation.
- Delivered actionable insights for campaign strategy and brand partnerships, suggesting alignment with health-conscious content to boost engagement.
