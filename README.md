### [Evaluation of PPA Akwa Ibom State Batch A Stream II 2025](https://mrjet2025.shinyapps.io/PPA_APP/)

#### Introduction.
In line with the objectives of the NYSC scheme, I conducted a preliminary evaluation of the Place of Primary Assignment (PPA) experience among Corps Members in Akwa Ibom State (Batch A Stream II).
The goal was to understand corps members’ living and working conditions, highlight challenges, and provide insights that may help improve welfare and productivity.

#### Methodology.
- Data Collection: A survey form was shared among Corps Members in Akwa Ibom State.
- Sample Size: 57 responses were collected.
- Process: The data was cleaned, analyzed, and summarized. An interactive R Shiny dashboard was developed to visualize the findings.
#### Key findings


1. Accommodation
- 21 out of 56 corps members (37.5%) reported that no accommodation was provided at their PPA.
2. PPA Category
- 47 respondents (83.9%) were posted to schools.
3. Satisfaction with PPA
- 26 corps members (46.4%) indicated they are not satisfied with their PPA.
4. Electricity Supply
- 19 respondents reported no electricity at all.
- 21 respondents reported unstable electricity.
- Only 9 reported stable electricity.

 #### Insights
- Accommodation and electricity are critical factors influencing corps members’ satisfaction.
The concentration of corps members in schools highlights the importance of educational institutions as major PPAs.
While this report is based on a small sample size, the findings give useful pointers on areas where corps members face challenges.
#### Conclusion & Next Steps
- This is an initial report based on 57 responses. A larger survey is recommended for a more representative evaluation. The findings so far suggest that improving accommodation and electricity conditions at PPAs could enhance corps members’ welfare and performance.



### [Analysis of no-show appointment with R](http://rpubs.com/Mrjet2020/1260641)
#### The project addressed the following question.
- Does the intervals between scheduledDays and appointmentDays have impact on  noshow rate.
- Are there days that when patient rarely visit hospital to meet up with.
- Which patient with particular diseases less come for appointment.
- Does the age group have impact on the no-show  rate.
- Do patient with more than one diseases increase no-show rate.
- Is the follow up scheme used appropriately.
 
### [Analysis of chips sales with R ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tg9Mu_1fYltgEG1EQC00vc3EQj3X8Qwd/view?usp=sharing)
